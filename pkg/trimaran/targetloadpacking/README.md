# Overview

This folder holds the `TargetLoadPacking` plugin implementation based on [Trimaran: Real Load Aware Scheduling](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/scheduler-plugins/blob/master/kep/61-Trimaran-real-load-aware-scheduling).

## TargetLoadPacking Plugin
`TargetLoadPacking` depends on [Load Watcher](https://github.com/paypal/load-watcher).
It uses `load-watcher` in two modes.
1. Using `load-watcher` as a service.
   You can run `load-watcher` service separately to provide real time node resource usage metrics for `TargetLoadPacking` to consume.
   Instructions to build and deploy load watcher can be found [here](https://github.com/paypal/load-watcher/blob/master/README.md).
   In this way, you just need to configure `watcherAddress: http://xxxx.svc.cluster.local:2020` to your `load-watcher` service. You can 
   also deploy `load-watcher` as a service in the same scheduler pod, 
   following the tutorial [here](https://medium.com/paypal-engineering/real-load-aware-scheduling-in-kubernetes-with-trimaran-a8efe14d51e2).
   
2. Using `load-watcher` as a library to fetch metrics from other providers, such as Prometheus, SignalFx and Kubernetes metric server.
   In this mode, you need to configure three parameters: `metricProviderType`, `metricProviderAddress` and `metricProviderToken` if authentication is needed.

   By default, `metricProviderType` is ` KubernetesMetricsServer` if not set. Now it supports `KubernetesMetricsServer`, `Prometheus` and `SignalFx`.
    - `metricProviderType: KubernetesMetricsServer` use `load-watcher` as a client library to retrieve metrics from Kubernetes metric
      server.
    - `metricProviderType: Prometheus` use `load-watcher` as a client library to retrieve metrics from Prometheus directly.
    - `metricProviderType: SignalFx` use `load-watcher` as a client library to retrieve metrics from SignalFx directly.

   `metricProviderAddress` and `metricProviderToken` should be configured according to `metricProviderType`.
    - You can ignore `metricProviderAddress` when using `metricProviderType: KubernetesMetricsServer`
    - Configure the prometheus endpoint for `metricProviderAddress` when using `metricProviderType: Prometheus`.
      An example could be `http://prometheus-k8s.monitoring.svc.cluster.local:9090`.

Apart from `watcherAddress`, you can configure the following in `TargetLoadPackingArgs`:

1) `targetUtilization` : CPU Utilization % target you would like to achieve in bin packing. It is recommended to keep this value 10 less than what you desire. Default if not specified is 40.
2) `defaultRequests` : This configures CPU requests for containers without requests or limits i.e. Best Effort QoS. Default is 1 core.
3) `defaultRequestsMultiplier` : This configures multiplier for containers without limits i.e. Burstable QoS. Default is 1.5

The following is an example config to use `load-watcher` as a library to retrieve metrics from pre-installed prometheus, achieve around 80% CPU utilization, with default CPU requests as 2 cores and requests multiplier as 2.

```yaml
apiVersion: kubescheduler.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: KubeSchedulerConfiguration
leaderElection:
  leaderElect: false
profiles:
- schedulerName: trimaran
  plugins:
    score:
      disabled:
      - name: NodeResourcesBalancedAllocation
      - name: NodeResourcesLeastAllocated
      enabled:
       - name: TargetLoadPacking
  pluginConfig:
  - name: TargetLoadPacking
    args:
      defaultRequests:
        cpu: "2000m"
      defaultRequestsMultiplier: "2"
      targetUtilization: 70
      metricProvider: 
        type: Prometheus
        address: http://prometheus-k8s.monitoring.svc.cluster.local:9090
```

Alternatively, you can use the `load-watcher` as a service in the config below.

```yaml
apiVersion: kubescheduler.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: KubeSchedulerConfiguration
leaderElection:
  leaderElect: false
profiles:
- schedulerName: trimaran
  plugins:
    score:
      disabled:
      - name: NodeResourcesBalancedAllocation
      - name: NodeResourcesLeastAllocated
      enabled:
       - name: TargetLoadPacking
  pluginConfig:
  - name: TargetLoadPacking
    args:
      defaultRequests:
        cpu: "2000m"
      defaultRequestsMultiplier: "2"
      targetUtilization: 70
      watcherAddress: http://127.0.0.1:2020
```
