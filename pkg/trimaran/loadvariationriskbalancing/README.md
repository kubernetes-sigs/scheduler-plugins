## LoadVariationRiskBalancing Plugin

`LoadVariationRiskBalancing` depends on [Load Watcher](https://github.com/paypal/load-watcher) service. Instructions to build and deploy load watcher can be found [here](https://github.com/paypal/load-watcher/blob/master/README.md).
`watcherAddress` argument below must be setup for `LoadVariationRiskBalancing` to work.

Apart from `watcherAddress`, you can configure the following in `LoadVariationRiskBalancingArgs`:

1) `safeVarianceMargin` : Multiplier of standard deviation. Default is 1.

Following is an example config:

```yaml
apiVersion: kubescheduler.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: KubeSchedulerConfiguration
leaderElection:
  leaderElect: false
profiles:
- schedulerName: trimaran
  plugins:
    score:
      enabled:
       - name: LoadVariationRiskBalancing
  pluginConfig:
  - name: LoadVariationRiskBalancing
    args:
      safeVarianceMargin: "1"
      watcherAddress: http://127.0.0.1:2020
```
