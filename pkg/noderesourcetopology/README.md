# Overview

This folder holds the Topology-aware scheduler plugin implementations based on [Topology aware scheduler plugin based on NodeResourceTopology CRD](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/scheduler-plugins/tree/master/kep/119-node-resource-topology-aware-scheduling/README.md). This plugin enables scheduling decisions based on worker node hardware topology overcoming the issue described [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/84869).

Document capturing the NodeResourceTopology API Custom Resource Definition Standard can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12kj3fK8boNuPNqob6F_pPU9ZTaNEnPGaXEooW1Cilwg/edit).

## Tutorial

### Expectation

In case the cumulative count of node resource allocatable appear to be the same for both the nodes in the cluster, topology aware scheduler plugin uses the CRD instance corresponding to the nodes to obtain the resource topology information to make a topology-aware scheduling decision.

**NOTE:**
- [NodeResourceTopology](https://github.com/k8stopologyawareschedwg/noderesourcetopology-api) version [v0.0.12](https://github.com/k8stopologyawareschedwg/noderesourcetopology-api/tree/v0.0.12) onwards, CRD has been changed from namespace to cluster scoped.
Scheduler plugin version > v0.21.6 depends on NodeResourceTopology CRD v0.0.12 or newer and the namespace field has been deprecated from the NodeResourceTopology scheduler config args.

### Compatibility Matrix

NodeResourceTopologyMatch plugin to work properly requires specific version of NodeResourceTopology CRD:

| Scheduler Plugins | NodeResourceTopology CRD version |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| master            | v0.1.0                           |
| v0.24.9           | v0.0.12                          |
| v0.23.10          | v0.0.12                          |
| v0.22.6           | v0.0.12                          |
| v0.21.6           | v0.0.10                          |
| v0.20.10          | v0.0.10                          |
| v0.19.9           | v0.0.10                          |

In case NodeResourceTopology CRD is being installed and advertised by [NFD](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/node-feature-discovery), check compatibility matrix below:

| Scheduler Plugins | NodeResourceTopology CRD version | NFD version |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|-------------|
| master            | v0.1.0                           | master      |
| v0.24.9           | v0.0.12                          | > v0.10.0   |
| v0.23.10          | v0.0.12                          | > v0.10.0   |

### Config

#### Scheduler

Enable the "NodeResourceTopologyMatch" Filter and Score plugins via SchedulerConfigConfiguration.

```yaml
apiVersion: kubescheduler.config.k8s.io/v1beta2
kind: KubeSchedulerConfiguration
leaderElection:
  leaderElect: false
clientConnection:
  kubeconfig: "/etc/kubernetes/scheduler.conf"
profiles:
- schedulerName: topo-aware-scheduler
  plugins:
    filter:
      enabled:
      - name: NodeResourceTopologyMatch
    score:
      enabled:
      - name: NodeResourceTopologyMatch
# optional plugin configs
  pluginConfig:
  - name: NodeResourceTopologyMatch
    args:
      # other strategies are MostAllocated and BalancedAllocation
      scoringStrategy:
        type: "LeastAllocated"
```

#### Scheduler-side cache with the reserve plugin

The quality of the scheduling decisions of the "NodeResourceTopologyMatch" filter and score plugins depends on the freshness of the resource allocation data.
When deployed on large clusters, or when facing high pod churn, or both, it's often impractical or impossible to have frequent enough updates, and the scheduler plugins
may run with stale data, leading to suboptimal scheduling decisions.
Using the Reserve plugin, the "NodeResourceTopologyMatch" Filter and Score can use a pessimistic overreserving cache which prevents these suboptimal decisions at the cost
of leaving pods pending longer. This cache is described in detail in [the docs/ directory](docs/).

To enable the cache, you need to **both** enable the Reserve plugin and to set the `cacheResyncPeriodSeconds` config options. Values less than 5 seconds are not recommended
for performance reasons.

```yaml
apiVersion: kubescheduler.config.k8s.io/v1beta2
kind: KubeSchedulerConfiguration
leaderElection:
  leaderElect: false
clientConnection:
  kubeconfig: "/etc/kubernetes/scheduler.conf"
profiles:
- schedulerName: topo-aware-scheduler
  plugins:
    filter:
      enabled:
      - name: NodeResourceTopologyMatch
    reserve:
      enabled:
      - name: NodeResourceTopologyMatch
    score:
      enabled:
      - name: NodeResourceTopologyMatch
# optional plugin configs
  pluginConfig:
  - name: NodeResourceTopologyMatch
    args:
      # other strategies are MostAllocated and BalancedAllocation
      scoringStrategy:
        type: "LeastAllocated"
      cacheResyncPeriodSeconds: 5
```

#### ScoringStrategy

The topology-aware scheduler supports four scoring strategies. You can set a strategy via SchedulerConfigConfiguration, by setting the scoringStrategy option.
There are four supported strategies:

* MostAllocated
* BalancedAllocation
* LeastAllocated
* LeastNUMANodes

The MostAllocated, BalancedAllocation and LeastAllocated strategies only work with the single-numa-node Topology Manager policy and indicate how score of the worker
node will be calculated based on current utilization:

* MostAllocated - favors node with the least amount of available resources
* BalancedAllocation - favors node with balanced resource usage rate
* LeastAllocated - favors node with the most amount of available resource

The LeastNUMANodes strategy works with all the Topology Manager policies and favors nodes which require the least amount of topology zones to satisfy the resource requests for a given pod.

#### Cluster

The Topology-aware scheduler performs its decision over a number of node-specific hardware details or configuration settings which have node granularity (not at cluster granularity).
Consistent settings across a set of nodes or all over the cluster is a fundamental prerequisite for the scheduler to work correctly.
In other words, it is a prerequisite that a set of nodes share the same NUMA topology and kubelet configuration, at least for settings like topology and resource (cpu, memory, device) managers.

However, the scheduler has no means to enforce or even validate this prerequisite;
for example the [NodeResourceTopology](https://github.com/k8stopologyawareschedwg/noderesourcetopology-api) CRD does not expose all the relevant fields, nor it should (it would be out of scope).

Hence, proper cluster configuration is expected from the cluster admins, or to other software components, like controllers or operators, outside the scope here.

Should the cluster need to have different settings (e.g. topology manager) or NUMA topologies, we recommend to use the
[standard kubernetes tools](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2017/03/advanced-scheduling-in-kubernetes/) to identify each set of nodes
using [affinity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/node-selection/#node-affinity-beta-feature) or also
[taints](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/node-selection/#taints-and-toleations-beta-feature).

#### Topology Manager configuration

***Target audience: developers and operators of topology updaters (NodeResourceTopology producers)***

In addition to logically partitioning a cluster like explained above, the topology-aware scheduler needs to know key node-specific configuration settings like Topology manager policy and scope.
This data is expected to be provided as top-level `Attributes` of the NodeResourceTopology objects:

NodeResourceTopology producers should add top-level `Attributes` in the following format
- For `Name` and `Value` of attributes, words should be `snakeCase`
- The `Name` of each attribute should be **the same of the corresponding kubelet configuration option**.
  - example: `--topology-manager-scope` becomes `topologyManagerScope`
  - example: `topologyManagerPolicy` becomes `topologyManagerPolicy`
- The `Value` of each attribute should be **one of the value of the corresponding kubelet configuration option, VERBATIM**.
  - example: `single-numa-node` becomes `single-numa-node`
- Should `topologyManagerOptions` be exposed:
  - they should be expanded in key-value pairs, using the `String()` representation
  - each key-value pair should be preceded by the `topologyManagerOption` prefix
  - every other provision described above applies
  - example: the `prefer-closest-numa-nodes` option becomes `topologyManagerOptionPreferClosestNumaNodes`, accepting exactly one of either `true` and `false`.
  - **RATIONALE**: this representation wants to guarantee all the Attribute Names are unique (no aliasing). It must be noted this is a stricter requirement with respect to the Attribute representation
    in NRT objects, and this requirement could be lifted in the future (an upgrade path will be provided).

### Demo

Let us assume we have two nodes in a cluster deployed with sample-device-plugin with the hardware topology described by the diagram below:

![Setup](numa-topology.png)

The hardware topology corresponding to both the nodes is represented by the below CRD instances. These CRD instances are supposed to be created by Node Agents like [Resource Topology Exporter](https://github.com/k8stopologyawareschedwg/resource-topology-exporter) (RTE) or Node feature Discovery (NFD). Please refer to issue [Exposing Hardware Topology through CRDs in NFD](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/node-feature-discovery/issues/333) and [Design document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q-4wSu1tzmbOXyGk_2r5_mK6JdXXJA-bOd3cAtBFnwo/edit?ts=5f24171f#) which captures details of enhancing NFD to expose node resource topology through CRDs.

For configuring your cluster with [NFD-topology updater](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/node-feature-discovery/blob/master/docs/get-started/introduction.md#nfd-topology-updater), a software component in Node Feature Discovery which creates NodeResourceTopology CRs corresponding to nodes in the cluster follow the Quick Start guide [here]( https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/node-feature-discovery/blob/master/docs/get-started/quick-start.md#additional-optional-installation-steps).

```yaml
# Worker Node A CRD spec
apiVersion: topology.node.k8s.io/v1alpha2
kind: NodeResourceTopology
metadata:
  name: worker-node-A
topologyPolicies: ["SingleNUMANodeContainerLevel"]
zones:
  - name: numa-node-0
    type: Node
    resources:
      - name: cpu
        capacity: 4
        allocatable: 3
      - name: example.com/deviceA
        capacity: 1
        allocatable: 1
      - name: example.com/deviceB
        capacity: 2
        allocatable: 2
  - name: numa-node-1
    type: Node
    resources:
      - name: cpu
        capacity: 4
        allocatable: 3
      - name: example.com/deviceA
        capacity: 2
        allocatable: 2
      - name: example.com/deviceB
        capacity: 1
        allocatable: 1
```

```yaml
# Worker Node B CRD spec
apiVersion: topology.node.k8s.io/v1alpha2
kind: NodeResourceTopology
metadata:
  name: worker-node-B
topologyPolicies: ["SingleNUMANodeContainerLevel"]
zones:
  - name: numa-node-0
    type: Node
    resources:
      - name: cpu
        capacity: 4
        allocatable: 3
      - name: example.com/deviceA
        capacity: 3
        allocatable: 3
  - name: numa-node-1
    type: Node
    resources:
      - name: cpu
        capacity: 4
        allocatable: 3
      - name: example.com/deviceB
        capacity: 3
        allocatable: 3
```

- Verify if the CRD has been created by running
    1. In case NFD/RTE is deployed in the cluster ensure that the CRD and CRD instances are created by running

       ```bash
         $ kubectl get noderesourcetopologies.topology.node.k8s.io
       ```

    1. Alternatively, in case you are just interested in simply testing the scheduler plugin, use the manifest in the manifest directory to deploy the CRD and CRs as follows:

         1. Deploy the Custom Resource Definition manifest

            ```bash
            $ kubectl create -f crd.yaml
            ```

         1. Check if the noderesourcetopologies.topology.node.k8s.io CRD is created

            ```bash
             $ kubectl get crd
             $ kubectl get noderesourcetopologies.topology.node.k8s.io
            ```

         1. Deploy the CRs representative of the hardware topology of the worker-node-A and worker-node-B if CRs haven't been created using RTE or NFD as mentioned above:

            ```bash
             $ kubectl create -f worker-node-A.yaml
             $ kubectl create -f worker-node-B.yaml
            ```
            NOTE: In case you are testing this demo by creating CRs manually, ensure that the names of the nodes in the cluster match the CR names.

- Copy cluster kubeconfig file to /etc/kubernetes/scheduler.conf
- Build the image locally

    ```bash
    $  make local-image
    ```

- Push the built image to the image registry:

    ```bash
    $ docker push <IMAGE_REGISTRY>/scheduler-plugins/kube-scheduler:latest
    ```

- Deploy the topology-aware scheduler plugin config

    ```bash
    $ kubectl  create -f scheduler-configmap.yaml
    ```

- Deploy the Scheduler plugin

    ```bash
    $ kubectl  create  -f cluster-role.yaml
    serviceaccount/topo-aware-scheduler created
    clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/noderesourcetoplogy-handler created
    clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/topo-aware-scheduler-as-kube-scheduler created
    clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/my-scheduler-as-volume-scheduler created
    rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/topo-aware-scheduler-as-kube-scheduler created
    clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/noderesourcetoplogy created

    $ kubectl create -f deploy.yaml
    deployment.apps/topo-aware-scheduler created
    ```

- Check if the scheduler plugin is deployed correctly by running the following

  ```script
  $ kubectl get pods -n kube-system -o wide
  NAME                                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   IP            NODE                 NOMINATED NODE   READINES
  topo-aware-scheduler-764c475854-vpmcw        1/1     Running   0          2s    10.244.0.14   kind-control-plane   <none>           <none>
  ```

- Deploy the pod to be scheduled with topology-aware scheduler plugin by populating the schedulerName: topo-aware-scheduler

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: test-deployment
spec:
  selector:
      matchLabels:
        name: test
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        name: test
    spec:
      schedulerName: topo-aware-scheduler
      containers:
      - name: test-deployment-1-container-1
        image: quay.io/fromani/numalign
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
        args: [ "while true; do numalign; sleep 100000; done;" ]
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: 1
            memory: 100Mi
            example.com/deviceA: 1
            example.com/deviceB: 1
          requests:
            cpu: 1
            memory: 100Mi
            example.com/deviceA: 1
            example.com/deviceB: 1
```

  ```bash
  $ kubectl create -f test-deployment.yaml
  deployment.apps/test-deployment created
  ```

- The test-deployment pod should be scheduled on the worker-node-A node

  ```script
  $ kubectl get pods -o wide
