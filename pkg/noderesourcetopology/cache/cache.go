	// GetCachedNRTCopy retrieves a NRT copy from cache, and then deducts over-reserved resources if necessary.
	// It will be used as the source of truth across the Pod's scheduling cycle.
	// Over-reserved resources are the resources consumed by pods scheduled to that node after the last update
	// of NRT pertaining to the same node, pessimistically overallocated on ALL the NUMA zones of the node.
	// The pod argument is used only for logging purposes.
	// Returns a boolean to signal the caller if the NRT data is clean. If false, then the node has foreign
	// Pods detected - so it should be ignored or handled differently by the caller.

	// NodeMaybeOverReserved declares a node was filtered out for not enough resources available.
	// This means this node is eligible for a resync. When a node is marked discarded (dirty), it matters not
	// if it is so because pessimistic overallocation or because the node truly cannot accomodate the request;
	// this is for the resync step to figure out.

	// NodeHasForeignPods declares we observed one or more pods on this node which wasn't scheduled by this
	// scheduler instance. This means the resource accounting is likely out of date, so this function also signals
	// a cache resync is needed for this node.
	// Until that happens, this node should not be considered in the scheduling decisions, like it has zero resources
	// available. Note this condition is different from "no topology info available".
	// The former is a always-fail, the latter is a always-succeed.

	// ReserveNodeResources add the resources requested by a pod to the assumed resources for the node on which the pod
	// is scheduled on. This is a prerequesite for the pessimistic overallocation tracking.
	// Additionally, this function resets the discarded counter for the same node. Being able to handle a pod means
	// that this node has still available resources. If a node was previously discarded and then cleared, we interpret
	// this sequence of events as the previous pod required too much - a possible and benign condition.
