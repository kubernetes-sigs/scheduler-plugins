## Summary

PEAKS (Power Efficiency Aware Kubernetes Scheduler) is a Kubernetes Scheduler plugin that aims to optimize the aggregate power consumption of the entire cluster during scheduling. It uses pre-trained Machine Learning models correlating Node Utilization with Power Consumption to predict the most suitable nodes for scheduling workloads. These predictions are based on the resource needs of incoming workloads and the real-time utilization of nodes within the cluster.

## Motivation

The Kubernetes scheduler framework supports multiple plugins, enabling the scheduling of pods on nodes to optimize various objectives. However, within the ecosystem, there lacks a solution specifically designed to optimize power efficiency while simultaneously fulfilling other scheduling goals.

A new plugin addresses this gap by incorporating power efficiency as a scheduling criterion alongside other objectives, such as optimizing resource allocation or adhering to specific topology requirements.

### Goals

1. Provide a configurable scheduling plugin to minimize the aggregate power consumption of the cluster.
2. Implement the aforementioned features as Score plugins.
3. Avoid altering the behavior of default score plugins unless it's necessary.

### Non Goals

1. De-scheduling resulting from unexpected outcomes (such as hot nodes or fragmentation) due to past scoring by plugins is not addressed in the initial design.
2. Memory, network, and disk utilization are not considered in the initial design.
3. The migration of already scheduled pods running on less power-efficient nodes to more power-efficient nodes is out of scope in the initial design.
4. Shutting down nodes to optimize power by migrating already running pods to other cluster nodes is out of scope in the initial design."

## Proposal

### User Stories

#### Story 1

With 'heterogeneous nodes' (variations in CPU architectures, a mixed cluster consisting of both VM and Bare Metal nodes, and dissimilar allocation of resources across nodes), cluster owners can reap benefits, as the power efficiency of different nodes may vary. This often necessitates the use of customized power models for each node within the cluster.

#### Story 2

Even with 'homogeneous nodes,' if the CPU vs. Power relationship is non-linear (such as piece-wise linear or concave), cluster owners can still benefit. Although the power efficiency might be consistent across all nodes, the varying CPU utilizations among nodes at any given time can significantly impact the aggregate power consumption of the cluster. Placing an incoming pod on one node versus another can influence this consumption.

### Notes/Constraints/Caveats

- The [Min, Max] score range for the plugin is user-configurable, defaulting to [0, 100].
- Additionally, the plugin normalizes the generated scores within the supplied [Min, Max] range.
- There isn't a singular model that comprehensively depicts the correlation between utilization and power consumption for every cluster node.
- At any given time, the current utilization of a node can be identified through metrics data.
- Determining the current power consumption can be achieved either through live metrics or by inference from the model that describes the relationship between node utilization and power consumption.
- Retraining the model representing this relationship may be necessary to better align with the workloads running on the node.

### Risks and Mitigations

- The benchmark test below captures the overhead resulting from model inferencing latency, which appears to be negligible.
- The accuracy of the model that captures the relationship between utilization and power relies heavily on the quality of the metrics used for its training. The current implementation supports integration with various user-selected metrics providers, such as node-metrics and Kepler
- PEAKS plugin requires the power model parameters for each cluster node configured with it. However, the power model (utilization vs. power consumption) parameters are subjected to change (e.g., increase in the number of CPUs on a node results in a change in the power model) over time. To address this, `configmap` is used as a mechanism to pass the updated power model parameters of any cluster node seamlessly.

## Design Details

### PEAKS workflow
![PEAKS workflow](./figs/PEAKS_workflow.png)

Here is a brief discription of some of the steps in the above workflow:
- Create a power model for each cluster node: If a power model suitable for the workload to be scheduled already exists, then the same can be used to avoid creating a new power model. Thus it is an optional step.
  - PEAKS plugin allows the cluster owners to bring their own power models that best represent both the node behavior and the workload characteristics.
  - Training the power model is outside the scope of PEAKS plugin.
  - PEAKS plugin only does power model inferencing.
  - Here is an example that models the "CPU utilization vs. Power" relationship for a two node cluster.
    - This model changes corresponding to a change either in the node configuration or in the workload characteristics.![Power-models-of-nodes](./figs/PowerModelsOfNodes.png)
- Get the resource need for a pod to be scheduled: This step requires estimating the pod resource needs.
  - Consider pod resource requirements (requests/limits) from its specification as an alternative.
  - If there are one or more running pods with the same image (case of auto scaling), consider the average load or resource need across those pods.
- Find the change in the utilization if the pod is to be scheduled on a node: This step requires the current utilization and the updated utilization after the pod placement on a node (so that the instantaneous power at both these utilizations can be found from the power model later)
  - Current node utilization can be queried from Prometheus (with the metric source provider being a service like node-exporter or load-watcher).
  - Add the change in utilization (corresponding to the pod resource requirement) to the current utilization to get the updated utilization
- Return the change in the node's instantaneous power:
  - The power consumption at the current utilization can be either found from the node metrics or by referring to the power model
  - The power consumption at the updated utilization can be found by referring to the power model
- Normalize plugin score: The score range can be provided by the user (otherwise consider the range [0, 100] as the default)
- Choose a suitable weight for PEAKS plugin in kube-scheduler configuration: This is specific to the environment configuration.
  - If the K8s cluster nodes are running using non-renewable energy sources, then a high weightage for PEAKS plugin can result into reduced CO2 emissions

### Pre-requisite modules
- Prometheus
  - For energy metrics collection
- Load-watcher
  - For collecting node usage metrics exported after processing metrics received from source
- Node-exporter
  - Source of node usage metrics
- Kepler
  - Source of energy consumption metrics

### Use-cases (that save energy using PEAKS plugin)
Below use-case scenarios demonstrate energy savings using PEAKS scheduler plugin over default kube-scheduler.
- Deployment of a Pod (via kube-scheduler):
  - On a K8s cluster with heterogeneous node configurations (resulting in the energy efficiency of the nodes not being the same), while deploying a pod, the `kube-scheduler` prefers energy efficient nodes for pod placement using PEAKS scheduler plugin vs. randomly selects a node for pod placement using default scheduler plugin.
    - Since energy savings decrease with the increased use of energy ineffecient nodes, PEAKS plugin favours pod placement on energy efficient nodes over pod placement on energy inefficient nodes.
  - Below graph demonstrates energy saving while kube-scheduler deploys a pod ![PEAKS with Kube-scheduler](./figs/PEAKS_with_Kube-scheduler.png)
    - The graph in the left depicts pod placement on the less energy effecient node which was randomly selected by default kube-scheduler.
    - The graph in the middle depicts pod placement on the more energy efficient node which was the preferred choice by PEAKS scheduler plugin.
    - The graph in the right depicts the savings in energy consumption across the cluster nodes over time (i.e., difference in the aggregate cluster energy consumed under PEAKS plugin placement vs. default scheduler placement) increas as the pods continue execution.
    - The energy savings will grow, when the node utilizations increase and/or pods run for longer duration (node utilizations were ~12% during this experiment which ran for 10 minutes).
- Scaling of a Pod (via Horizontal Pod Autoscaler):
  - On a K8s cluster with heterogeneous node configurations (resulting in the energy efficiency of the nodes not being the same), a deployment configured with HPA packs the pods on nodes using PEAKS scheduler plugin vs. spreads the pods on nodes using default kube-scheduler.
    - Since energy savings decrease with the increased use of energy ineffecient nodes, PEAKS plugin favours pod placement on energy efficient nodes over pod placement on energy inefficient nodes.
  - Below graph demonstrates energy saving while auto scaling pods with HPA controller ![PEAKS with HPA](./figs/PEAKS_with_HPA.png)
    - The graph in the left depicts spreading of pods on nodes using default kube-scheduler.
    - The graph in the middle depicts packing of pods on energy efficient nodes before pod placement on energy (relatively) inefficient cluster nodes using PEAKS scheduler plugin.
    - The graph in the right depicts the savings in energy across the cluster nodes over time (i.e., difference in the aggregate cluster energy consumed under PEAKS plugin placement vs. default scheduler placement) as the pods scale up.
    - There is ~10\% of energy savings observed at the end of 15 minutes of workload execution in this experiment.
    - Note that the difference in the aggregate energy consumption of the cluster nodes reduces (highlighted in red circle) as PEAKS plugin places pods on energy inefficient nodes.
- Kubectl scale command (while resizing of a deployment, replica set, replication controller, or stateful set):
  - On a K8s cluster with heterogeneous node configurations (resulting in the energy efficiency of the nodes not being the same), scaling a pod of a deployment, replica set, replication controller, or stateful set with `kubectl scale` command packs the pods on nodes using PEAKS scheduler plugin vs. spreads the pods on nodes using default kube-scheduler.
    - Since energy savings decrease with the increased use of energy ineffecient nodes, PEAKS plugin favours pod placement on energy efficient nodes over pod placement on energy inefficient nodes.
  - The experiment below demonstrates energy savings while scaling pods with `kubectl scale` command.
    - The pods of a deployment "cpu-stress-test" were initially placed on the energy efficient node "tantawi1". Exercising `kubectl scale` to increase the number of pods from 2 to 5 spreads the newly created pods across the nodes "tantawi1" and "tantawi2" irrespective of their energy effeciency with default kube-scheduler. ![Kubectl-scale_Default](./figs/Kubectl-scale_Default.png)
    - The pods of a deployment "cpu-stress-test" were initially placed on the energy efficient node "tantawi1". Exercising `kubectl scale` to increase the number of pods from 2 to 5 packs the newly created pods on the energy efficient node "tantawi1" with PEAKS scheduler plugin. ![Kubectl-scale_PEAKS](./figs/Kubectl-scale_PEAKS.png)
    - While `kubectl scale` is used to decrease the number of pods, scheduler (PEAKS plugin) doesn't have any role to play. Hence, pods running on on more energy efficient nodes may get evicted. One may use pod priority and preemption to evict pods from less energy efficient nodes as a workaround.
- Migration of a Pod (via explicit eviction)
  - An application pods might be placed on the energy ineffecient cluster nodes at the time of scheduling as other applications might be running on the energy effecient nodes. When one or more of those applications complete, resources become available on the energy efficient cluster nodes. Two options are available at this stage:
    - Either the application pods continue to run on the nodes on which they were originally placed.
    - Or, those pods may be migrated to energy efficient nodes to save energy.
  - Periodically check the resource availability on energy efficient nodes via a script. When resources are available, the same script deletes the application pods running on energy inefficient nodes so that the scheduler (configured with PEAKS plugin) places them on the best possible energy efficient nodes.
    - This mimics auto-migration of application pods from energy inefficient nodes to energy efficient nodes to save energy consumption.
    - Identification of the target node for the migration of a pod from an energy inefficient node is carried out by the PEAKS plugin.
    - A pod might need to be deleted more than once before finding the best energy efficient node for its placement by the scheduler.
  - The experiment below demonstrates this use-case.
    - The pods of a deployment "cpu-stress-test" were initially placed on the energy efficient node "tantawi1". As a result, only one of the pod of the deployment "php-apache" could be placed on the node "tantawi1" and its second pod is placed on the energy inefficient node "tantawi2". ![Pod-migration-stage-1](./figs/Migration_InitialPlacement.png)
    - Even after the completion of the deployment "cpu-stress-test", a pod of the deployment "php-apache" continues to run on "tantawi2".![Pod-migration-stage-2](./figs/Migration_IntermediatePlacement.png)
    - Deleting the pod from "tantawi2" triggers creation of a new pod by the deployment to meet the desired number of replicas and scheduler places the pod on the energy efficient node "tantawi1" now (In contrast, the default kube-scheduler would place the pod on the same node "tantawi2" as it spreads the pods across cluster nodes). ![Pod-migration-stage-3](./figs/Migration_FinalPlacement.png)
- Shutting down of a cluster node (via Cluster Autoscaler)
  - Pod migration to a more energy efficient cluster node (demonstrated in the previous use-case) redcues the active power consumption on the less energy efficient nodes.
  - Migrate each pod (irrespective of the deployment it belongs to) running on a less energy efficient node to (relatively) more energy efficient cluster nodes by repeated execution of individual pod migration (under assumption that there are enough resources on the more energy efficient cluster nodes).
  - After all the pods are migrated, the utilization of the energy inefficient node becomes low which triggers the Cluster Autoscaler to delete that node.
    - Node shutdown results in highest energy savings as it elimiates both the active and idle power consumption of a node.
    - The graph below dipicts that the idle energy consumption of a node is a significant portion of the node's total power consumption.![NodeShutdown-IdleEnergySaving](./figs/NodeShutdown_IdleEnergySaving.png)

## Production Readiness Review Questionnaire
### Feature Enablement and Rollback
How can this feature be enabled / disabled in a live cluster?
  - Feature gate (also fill in values in kep.yaml)
    - Feature gate name:
    - Components depending on the feature gate:
  - Other
    - Describe the mechanism:
    - Will enabling / disabling the feature require downtime of the control plane?
    - Will enabling / disabling the feature require downtime or reprovisioning of a node?

Does enabling the feature change any default behavior?

It is an optional feature. It changes the way pods are placed on the nodes (like packing of pods on nodes vs. spreading of pods on nodes by default)

Can the feature be disabled once it has been enabled (i.e. can we roll back the enablement)?

Yes

What happens if we re-enable the feature if it was previously rolled back?

It is an optional feature. At any point, a deployment can specify to include PEAKS plugin configuration or not as desired. In other words, this feature can be re-enabled seemlessly even if it was previously rolled back.

Are there any tests for feature enablement/disablement?

Unit tests are available with `code coverage` > 90%. This is an optional plugin which can be easily included in the scheduler configuration as required.

### Rollout, Upgrade and Rollback Planning
How can a rollout or rollback fail? Can it impact already running workloads?

All the already scheduled pods continue to run. New pods can be scheduled using this plugin or not as needed.

What specific metrics should inform a rollback?

The PEAKS plugin can be selected per deployment granularity. Simply don't use the PEAKS scheduler configuration while deploying a pod if energy aware scheduling of pods on nodes is not a requirement.

Were upgrade and rollback tested? Was the upgrade->downgrade->upgrade path tested?

Yes

Is the rollout accompanied by any deprecations and/or removals of features, APIs, fields of API types, flags, etc.?

N/A

### Monitoring Requirements
How can an operator determine if the feature is in use by workloads?

By inspecting the workload deployment YAML file (kubectl edit deployment name-of-the-deployment)as it should specify the custom scheduler configuration to use this functionality.

How can someone using this feature know that it is working for their instance?
- Events
  - Event Reason:
- API .status
  - Condition name:
  - Other field:
- Other (treat as last resort)
  - Details:

What are the reasonable SLOs (Service Level Objectives) for the enhancement?

The PEAKS scheduler plugin aims to reduce the energy consumption for workload execution. The amount of energy savings depend on the cluster configuration and workload characteristics.

What are the SLIs (Service Level Indicators) an operator can use to determine the health of the service?
- Metrics
  - Metric name:
  - [Optional] Aggregation method:
  - Components exposing the metric:
- Other (treat as last resort)
  - Details:

Are there any missing metrics that would be useful to have to improve observability of this feature?

### Dependencies
Does this feature depend on any specific services running in the cluster?

Yes, it depends on the Prometheus service running in the cluster for metrics (utilization and energy consumption) collection.

### Scalability
Will enabling / using this feature result in any new API calls?

No.

Will enabling / using this feature result in introducing new API types?

No.

Will enabling / using this feature result in any new calls to the cloud provider?

No.

Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing size or count of the existing API objects?

No.

Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing time taken by any operations covered by [existing SLIs/SLOs](https://git.k8s.io/community/sig-scalability/slos/slos.md#kubernetes-slisslos)?

No.

Will enabling / using this feature result in non-negligible increase of resource usage (CPU, RAM, disk, IO, ...) in any components?

No - the metrics are cached at load watcher and our plugins will only pull them when needed, and this shouldnâ€™t be a non-negligible increase in resource usage. Moreover, the algorithms provided run in linear time for number of nodes.

Can enabling / using this feature result in resource exhaustion of some node resources (PIDs, sockets, inodes, etc.)?

No.

### Troubleshooting
How does this feature react if the API server and/or etcd is unavailable?

Running pods are not affected. Any new submissions would be rejected by scheduler.

What are other known failure modes?

N/A

What steps should be taken if SLOs are not being met to determine the problem?

N/A
